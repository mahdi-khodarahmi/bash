In this script, which is written in bash Linux, you can see the future and the past date!
For example, you want to know that 65 days and 7 months and 3 years later, what day it is?
Or for example you want to know 20 days and 10 months and 500 years ago, what day it was?
With this script you can do. Future versions will also be added to the calendar.
